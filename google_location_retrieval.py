Problem:
    Using the Google Maps API, retrieve the JSON response after
    applying a query parameter filter to the geocode endpoint. Then take
    the reponse and transform it to produce the expected output:

         Green Bay

         ID: <insert place_id here>

         Latitude: <insert latitude here>

         Longitude: <insert longitude here>


    Starting Endpoint: http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json

    status = private ( please reach out to me to access this, I just didn't
                want to have my code accessable by other possible
                participants )

Comments:
    * Hooking project to source control for my own benefit as well as
        offering recruiters the chance to see how my code develops
    
Todos:
    * Sign-in to Google Console and retrieve API key
    * Connect to the API using the given link to retrieve JSON object
